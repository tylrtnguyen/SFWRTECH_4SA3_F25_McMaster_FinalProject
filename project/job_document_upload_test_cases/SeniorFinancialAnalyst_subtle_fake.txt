## Red Flags for Testing (Educational Markers)

This posting contains subtle indicators that **JobTrust should flag for verification:**

- Vague founding year (2019) without verifiable public records or press coverage.
- No specific client names, partnerships, or case studies despite claims of serving "mid-market businesses."
- Salary range is wide ($20K spread) without clear justification based on experience level.
- "Unlimited PTO" is mentioned casually without clarity on how it's tracked or enforced (common in scams that promise flexibility but don't deliver).
- Generic company website URL with no SSL certificate verification or domain WHOIS details provided.
- No LinkedIn company page, Glassdoor reviews, or public job history mentioned.
- Vague requirement: "willingness to learn quickly" can mask inadequate onboarding or unclear expectations.
- Email contact is a generic "careers@" address with no named hiring manager or recruiter.
- No mention of background check, reference checks, or standard hiring process steps.
- "Fast-paced, evolving environment" is a common euphemism for poor process or job instability in scam postings.
- Stock options mentioned without vesting schedule, strike price, or cap table transparency details.
